#The or-channel / The or-done-channel Pattern

To deal with more complex synchronization patterns, one such pattern is the Or-Channel, also known as the Or-Done-Channel. The Or-Channel is a powerful concept that allows you to combine multiple channels into a single channel, providing a way to wait for the first value or signal to be received from any of the input channels. It acts as a logical OR operator among the channels, ensuring that as soon as any channel sends a value or is closed, the Or-Channel receives that value or signal.
Use Case
Imagine a scenario where you want to perform multiple order requests simultaneously with pipeline pattern for each order (stage 1 (Validation Goroutine) , stage 2 (Enrichment Goroutine), and stage 3 (Calculation Goroutine)) and process accordinly all the responses that arrive. The Or-Channel allows you to achieve this behavior elegantly.


Stage 1 (Validation)
Each order is received and validated for correctness and completeness. Any invalid orders are filtered out.

Stage 2 (Enrichment)
The valid orders are then enriched with additional information, such as customer details or product data, to enhance their content.

Stage 3 (Calculation)
The enriched orders are processed further to perform calculations, such as total order value or shipping costs.

Each stage is implemented as a separate goroutine, and channels are used to connect the stages. The orders flow through the pipeline, with each stage concurrently processing the orders it receives. This allows for parallelism, as multiple orders can be processed simultaneously by different stages.


In this code, the done channel is used to signal termination and gracefully shut down the concurrent stages of the pipeline.
