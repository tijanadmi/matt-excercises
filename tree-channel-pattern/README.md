#Tee-Channel Pattern

The tee-channel pattern refers to a mechanism where a single channel is split into multiple channels to enable parallel processing of the data stream. It allows multiple consumers to receive the same data simultaneously.
Use Case
Imagine you have a system that receives a continuous stream of sensor data from multiple sensors distributed throughout a factory. You want to perform real-time analysis on this data and simultaneously store it for historical purposes. By utilizing a tee-channel, you can achieve this efficiently.
Here's how it would work:
To implement a tee-channel in Go, you can create a function that takes a source channel and multiple destination channels as arguments. Within this function, you can use a goroutine that loops over the source channel and sends the received values to all the destination channels.

The tee function takes a source channel source and a variadic argument destinations, which represents multiple destination channels. It launches a goroutine that continuously reads values from the source channel and sends them to each destination channel using a loop.Once the source channel is closed, the function closes all the destination channels to signal that no more values will be sent.

By using goroutines and channels, we achieve concurrent processing of the same data stream, allowing real-time analysis and storage to happen simultaneously.
