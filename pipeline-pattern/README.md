#Pipeline Pattern

The pipeline pattern in Go is a concurrency pattern used for efficiently processing large amounts of data. It involves dividing a complex task into smaller stages, each executed concurrently by separate goroutines.The output of one stage is passed as input to the next stage through channels, forming a pipeline.
Use Case
Let's say you have a system that needs to process a large dataset of customer orders. Each order goes through several stages of processing, such as validation, enrichment, and final calculation. Instead of sequentially processing each order, you can utilize the pipeline pattern to parallelize the processing and improve overall efficiency.
Here's how the pipeline pattern can be used in this scenario:
Stage 1 (Validation): Each order is received and validated for correctness and completeness. Any invalid orders are filtered out.
Stage 2 (Enrichment): The valid orders are then enriched with additional information, such as customer details or product data, to enhance their content.
Stage 3 (Calculation): The enriched orders are processed further to perform calculations, such as total order value or shipping costs.

Stage 1 (Validation)
Each order is received and validated for correctness and completeness. Any invalid orders are filtered out.

Stage 2 (Enrichment)
The valid orders are then enriched with additional information, such as customer details or product data, to enhance their content.

Stage 3 (Calculation)
The enriched orders are processed further to perform calculations, such as total order value or shipping costs.

Each stage is implemented as a separate goroutine, and channels are used to connect the stages. The orders flow through the pipeline, with each stage concurrently processing the orders it receives. This allows for parallelism, as multiple orders can be processed simultaneously by different stages.


By using the pipeline pattern, you can efficiently process a large number of orders in a scalable and concurrent manner. This can significantly reduce the overall processing time and improve the performance of your system.
